<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE:  The programming was done on my ultrawide monitor (21:9 ratio) which means
     all of the elements will not be exactly the same on most of the monitors.
      I tried to do it as portable as possible but again, it will not look perfect.
       I recommend zooming out the whole website to around 75% - 65% for the optimal view (for 16:9 ratios). -->

                        studying the NPA Access to Cyber Security and Software Development course.
                        I am from Poland and I'm currently 18, for my career, I want to become as a
                        Software Engineer or perhaps, a Web Designer.

                        So what are my interests? Well, one of the most favourite things I do is
                        coding. I love learning new programming languages and creating scripts.
                        Another thing I like to do is gaming. I play variety of games such as Forza Horizon 4, Factorio and Witcher 3.
                        This is not the only interest I have, now and then I read books and meditate in the morning
                        and evening. It's a great way to spend free time and relax yourself. I also love to cycle,
                        that feeling being surrounded by nature, especially with friends.
